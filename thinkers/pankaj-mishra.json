  "tagline": "Essayist examining modernity, globalization, and ressentiment",
  "bio": "Pankaj Mishra is an Indian essayist and novelist who writes about globalization, modernity, and the political and psychological costs of rapid change. His work examines how the promise of Western modernity has produced crisis, resentment, and violence across the globe, particularly in Asia and the developing world.\n\nMishra draws on deep reading in literature, history, and philosophy to analyze contemporary politics. He traces connections between 19th-century European reactions to modernity and 21st-century populism and extremism worldwide, showing how ressentiment—frustrated desire for recognition and dignity—drives political upheaval.\n\nHis writing is intellectually ambitious and deliberately unsettling, challenging Western-centric narratives about progress, development, and civilization. He represents a non-Western perspective on global modernity that centers the costs and contradictions of development.",
