  "bio": "Yuval Noah Harari is a historian who takes the long viewâ€”really long. His work examines human history from the cognitive revolution 70,000 years ago to potential futures with AI and bioengineering. He's become one of the most widely-read contemporary historians by asking big questions about what makes us human and where we're headed.\n\nHarari's approach is to identify key revolutions (cognitive, agricultural, scientific) that fundamentally reshaped human society, then trace their consequences. He writes accessibly about complex historical processes, though some historians critique his broad generalizations. His focus has expanded from historical analysis to contemporary challenges like technology, meaning, and political systems.\n\nWhat makes Harari distinctive is his willingness to connect ancient history with pressing contemporary questions. He's equally comfortable discussing Mesopotamian grain stores and modern data algorithms, always asking: what does this mean for human flourishing?",
