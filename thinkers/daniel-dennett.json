  "tagline": "Philosopher exploring consciousness, evolution, and free will",
  "bio": "Daniel Dennett is a philosopher and cognitive scientist who has spent his career making the hardest questions about mind and consciousness accessible to broader audiences. He's known for his work on consciousness, free will, evolution, and the nature of belief, combining rigorous philosophical analysis with insights from biology and AI.\n\nHis approach is materialist and evolutionaryâ€”he argues that consciousness and meaning emerge from physical processes, and that understanding evolution is key to understanding mind. Dennett is skilled at using thought experiments and analogies to make abstract concepts concrete, though his views on consciousness and free will are sometimes controversial.\n\nHe's written extensively about religion, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind, always aiming to demystify complex topics without oversimplifying them. His work bridges philosophy, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology.",
