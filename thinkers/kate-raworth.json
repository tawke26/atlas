  "bio": "Kate Raworth is an economist who challenges the fundamental assumptions of traditional economic thinking. She's best known for developing the 'Doughnut Economics' model—a visual framework that places the economy within social foundations and ecological ceilings, arguing that thriving lies in the space between.\n\nHer work questions the obsession with GDP growth, asking instead what economy would look like if it were designed to meet everyone's needs within the means of the planet. She draws on ecological economics, complexity theory, and feminist economics to reimagine economic goals and measurements.\n\nRaworth teaches at Oxford and works with cities, businesses, and governments worldwide to apply doughnut thinking. Her approach is systemic rather than incremental—she's interested in fundamentally reframing how we think about economic success rather than tweaking existing models.",
