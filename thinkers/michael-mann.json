  "bio": "Michael E. Mann is a climate scientist best known for the 'hockey stick' graph showing dramatic recent warming, and for his public defense of climate science against organized denial campaigns. His research reconstructs past climates to understand long-term patterns and project future changes.\n\nMann has become a prominent voice not just for climate science but against the deliberate spread of climate misinformation. He's documented how fossil fuel interests have funded doubt campaigns and attacked scientists. This has made him a target, but also given him unique insight into the politics of science denial.\n\nHis work combines technical climatology with public engagement and advocacy. Mann argues scientists have a responsibility to speak clearly about what evidence shows and to push back against bad-faith attacks on science itself.",
